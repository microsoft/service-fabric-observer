# FabricObserver

**FabricObserver (FO)** is a complete implementation of a generic resource usage watchdog service written as a stateless, singleton Service Fabric application that 
1. Monitors a broad range of resources that tend to be important to all Service Fabric applications, like disk, CPU, memory, networking, and cluster certificates out-of-the-box.
2. Provides a simple model in which new observers can be built and configured and run automatically through a .NET development model.

FO is a Stateless Service Fabric Application composed of a single service that runs on every node in your cluster, so it can be deployed and run alongside your applications without any changes to them. Each FO service instance knows nothing about other FO instances in the cluster, by design.  


> FO is not an alternative to existing Monitoring and Diagnostics services. Running side-by-side with existing monitoring services, FO provides useful and timely health information for the nodes (VMs), apps, and services that make up your Service Fabric deployment.

FabricObserver comes with a number of Observers that run out-of-the-box. Observers are specialized objects which wake up, monitor a specific set of resources, emit a health report, and sleep again. However, the thresholds and configurations of the included observers must be set to match the specific needs of your cluster. These settings can be set via [Settings.xml](/FabricObserver/PackageRoot/Config/Settings.xml).

When a Warning threshold is reached or exceeded, an observer will send a Health Report to Service Fabric's Health management system (either as a Node or App Health Report, depending on the observer). This Warning state and related reports are viewable in SFX, the Service Fabric EventStore, and Azure's Application Insights, if enabled.

Most observers will remove the Warning state in cases where the issue is transient, but others will maintain a long-running Warning for applications/services/nodes/security problems observed in the cluster. For example, high CPU usage above the user-assigned threshold for a VM or App/Service will put a Node into Warning State (NodeObserver) or Application Warning state (AppObserver), for example, but will soon go back to Healthy if it is a transient spike or after you mitigate the specific problem :-). An expiring certificate Warning from CertificateObsever, however, will remain until you update your application's certificates (Cluster certificates are already monitored by the SF runtime. This is not the case for Application certificates, so use CertificateObserver for this, if necessary).

FO ships with an AppInsights telemetry implementation, other providers can be used by implementing the [IObserverTelemetryProvider interface](/FabricObserver/Observers/Interfaces/IObserverTelemetryProvider.cs). 

For more information about **the design of FabricObserver**, please see the [Design readme](./Documentation/Design.md). 

## Build and run

1. Clone the repo.
2. If you want to use the optional [FabricObserver API Service](/FabricObserverWeb) and you are using VS 2019, you must install [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2). If you are using VS 2017, then install [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), as VS2017 does not support 2.2.
2. Build (the required Nuget packages will be downloaded and installed automatically by Visual Studio). 

FabricObserver can be run and deployed through Visual Studio or Powershell, like any SF app.  

## Using FabricObserver  

To quickly learn how to use FO, please see the **[simple scenario-based examples](./Documentation/Using.md)**.  


## Observer Model

FO is composed of Observer objects (instance types) that are designed to observe, record, and report on several machine-level environmental conditions inside a Windows VM (node) of a Service Fabric cluster. It is an isolated, node-only service. 

Since observers live in their own application, they monitor other applications through the resource side effects of those applications. Here are the current observers and what they monitor:

| Resource | Observer |
| --- | --- |
| Disk (local storage disk health/availability, space usage, IO) | DiskObserver |
| CPU/Memory (per process across Apps and Fabric system services) | NodeObserver |
| OS properties (install date, health status, list of hot fixes, hardware configuration, etc., ephemeral port range and real-time OS health status) | OSObserver |
| Networking (general health and monitoring of availability of user-specified, per-app endpoints) | NetworkObserver |
| Service Fabric Infrastructure | FabricSystemObserver |
| Application certificates | CertificateObserver |
| **Another resource you find important** | **Observer you implement** |

To learn more about the current Observers and their configuration, please see the [Observers readme](./Documentation/Observers.md).  
    
```
Just observe it.
