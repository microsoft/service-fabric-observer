# FabricObserver

**FabricObserver (FO)** is a working implementation of a Service Fabric watchdog service as a Service Fabric application that 
1. Monitors a broad range of resources that tend to be important to all service fabric applications, like disk, CPU, memory, networking, and cluster certificates out-of-the-box.
2. Provides a simple model in which new observers can be built and configured and run automatically through a .NET development model.

FO is a standalone Stateless Service Fabric Application that runs on each cluster node, so it can be deployed and run alongside your applications without any change to them.


> FO is not an alternative to existing Monitoring and Diagnostics services. Running side-by-side with existing monitoring services, FO provides useful and timely health information for the nodes (VMs), apps, and services that make up your Service Fabric deployment.

## How it works

FabricObserver comes with a number of Observers that run out-of-the-box. Observers are specialized objects which wake up, monitor a specific set of resources, emit a health report, and sleep again. However, the thresholds and configurations of the included observers must be set to match the specific needs of your cluster. These settings can be set via [Settings.xml](/FabricObserver/PackageRoot/Config/Settings.xml).

> It is not recommended to run FO with the default thresholds. It is recommended to first enable observers with ignored thresholds (by setting the threshold to 0), then run FO to monitor over a learning period the baseline behavior of your cluster along the measured metrics. After the learning period, the observers should be enabled with thresholds that make sense for the cluster.

In Warning and Error states, an observer will signal `Warning` Service Fabric Health Reports. This warning state and related reports are viewable in SFX, the EventStore, and AppInsights, if enabled. Most observers will clean the Warning state in the case the issue is transient, but others will indicate a long-running problem with applications in the cluster. For example, high CPU usage above the user-assigned threshold will put a cluster in Warning State if the NodeObserver is enabled, but will soon go back to Healthy if it is a transient spike. An expiring certificate Warning however will remain until the user takes manual intervention to update their application's certificates.

FO ships with an AppInsights telemetry implementation, other providers can be used by implementing the [IObserverTelemetryProvider interface](/FabricObserver/Observers/Interfaces/IObserverTelemetryProvider.cs).

## Build and run

1. Clone the repo.
2. Build (the required Nuget packages will be downloaded and installed automatically by Visual Studio).
3. If you want to use the [FabricObserver API Service](/FabricObserverWeb) and you are using VS 2019, you must install [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2). If you are using VS 2017, then install [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1), as VS2017 does not support 2.2.

FabricObserver can be run and deployed through Visual Studio or Powershell, like any SF app.

## Observer Model

FO is composed of Observer objects (instance types) that are designed to observe, record, and report on several machine-level environmental conditions inside a Windows VM (node) of a Service Fabric cluster. It is an isolated, node-only service. 

Since observers live in their own application, they monitor other applications through the resource side effects of those applications. Here are the current observers and what they monitor:

| Resource | Observer |
| --- | --- |
| Disk (local storage disk health/availability, space usage, IO) | DiskObserver |
| CPU/Memory (per process across Apps and Fabric system services) | NodeObserver |
| OS properties (install date, health status, list of hot fixes, hardware configuration, etc., ephemeral port range and real-time OS health status) | OSObserver |
| Networking (general health and monitoring of availability of user-specified, per-app endpoints) | NetworkObserver |
| Service Fabric Infrastructure | FabricSystemObserver |
| Application certificates | CertificateObserver |
| **Another resource you find important** | **Observer you implement** |

To learn more about the current Observers and their configuration, please see the [Observers readme](./Documentation/Observers.md).

Just observe it.
