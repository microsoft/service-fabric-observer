# How to deploy FabricObserver?

Like all elementary services such as monitoring, Windows update, scripts, scaling, etc. those services should be installed with the initial cluster deployment. 

There are two options:
1. Add the resource provided in the ARM template service-fabric-observer.json in the template which also deploys the Service Fabric cluster. To guarantee the correct deployment order the first resource has to depend on the cluster resource. 

```ARM
    {
	    "apiVersion": "[variables('sfApiVersion')]",
      "type": "Microsoft.ServiceFabric/clusters/applicationTypes",
      "name": "[concat(parameters('clusterName'), '/', variables('applicationTypeName'))]",
      "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
      "dependsOn": [
        "[concat('Microsoft.ServiceFabric/clusters/', parameters('clusterName'))]"
      ],
      "properties": {
        "provisioningState": "Default"
      }
    },
``` 

2. The app can be deployed manually by using the provided PowerShell script file 'Deploy-FabricObserver.ps1'.
