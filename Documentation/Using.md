# Using FabricObserver - Scenarios


> You can learn all about the currently implemeted Observers and their supported resource properties [***here***](/Documentation/Observers.md). 


**CPU Usage - CPU Time (percent), all cores**  


***Problem***: I want to know how much CPU my App is using and emit a warning when a specified threshold is reached... 

***Solution***: AppObserver is your friend. You can do exactly this, plus more. :)  

> A Service Fabric Application is a logical "container" of related services, an abstract encapsulation of versioned configuration and code.

For an app named MyApp, you would simply add this to PackageRoot/Config/AppObserver.config.json:  

```JSON 
[
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/MyApp",
    "cpuWarningLimitPercent": 65
  }
]
```

Now, let's say you have more then one App deployed (a common scenario) and only want to watch one or more of the services in a specific set of apps. 
You would add this to PackageRoot/Config/AppObserver.config.json:

```JSON 
[
 {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/MyApp",
    "serviceIncludeList": "ILikeCpuService, ILikeCpuTooService",
    "cpuWarningLimitPercent": 45
  },
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/MyOtherApp",
    "serviceIncludeList": "ILoveCpuService",
    "cpuWarningLimitPercent": 65
  }
]
```

Example Output in SFX (Warning): 


![alt text](/Documentation/Images/AppObsWarn.png "AppObserver Warning Output example.")  


SF Event Store (Warning and Clear (Ok)):  


![alt text](/Documentation/Images/CpuWarnEventsClear.jpg "AppObserver Health Event example.")  

<a name="targetType"></a>You can also supply a targetType parameter instead of a target in AppObserver.config.json. This instructs FO to monitor all applications of a given ApplicationType (this is an advanced SF deployment scenario, generally, but it is very useful for large or complex systems with many apps). All app services of a given type will be observed and reported on with specified Warning thresholds.
When you use this property, you can also use either serviceExcludeList or serviceIncludeList JSON property settings to further filter what you want observed and reported.

```JSON 
[
  {
    "targetAppType": "MyAppType",
    "cpuWarningLimitPercent": 40,
    "memoryWarningLimitPercent": 30,
    "networkWarningActivePorts": 80,
    "networkWarningEphemeralPorts": 40,
    "serviceExcludeList": "someService42,someService53"
  }
]
```  

**Active TCP Ports**  

***Problem***: I want to know when any of the services belonging to application fabric:/MyApp have opened more than 2000 TCP ports and generate a Health Warning.  

***Solution***: AppObserver is your friend. This is simple.  

```JSON
[
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/MyApp",
    "networkWarningActivePorts": 2000
  }
]
```

**Active Ephemeral TCP Ports**  

***Problem***: I want to know when any of the services belonging to application fabric:/MyApp have opened more than 1500 Ephemeral (dynamic range) TCP ports and generate a Health Warning.  

***Solution***: AppObserver is your friend. This is simple.  

```JSON
[
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/MyApp",
    "networkWarningEphemeralPorts": 1500
  }
]
```  

You should of course combine these into one:  

```JSON
[
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/MyApp",
    "networkWarningActivePorts": 2000,
    "networkWarningEphemeralPorts": 1500
  }
]
```


**File Handles**  

***Problem***: I want to know how many file handles (total allocated/open) my App services are using and emit a warning when a specified threshold is reached.

***Solution***: AppObserver is your friend. You can do exactly this.  

For an app named MyApp, you would simply add this to PackageRoot/Config/AppObserver.config.json:  

```JSON 
[
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/MyApp",
    "warningOpenFileHandles": 2000
  }
]
``` 

So, based on the above configuration, when the number of open file handles held by any of the designated app's services reaches 2000 or higher, FO will emit a Health Warning.  

**Threads**  

***Problem***: I want to know how many threads an App service is using and emit a warning when a specified threshold is reached.

***Solution***: AppObserver is your friend. You can do exactly this. 

```JSON
[
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/MyApp42",
    "warningThreadCount": 500
  }
]
```

**Resource Governance - Memory**  

***Problem:*** I want FabricObserver to warn me when one of my RG-enabled (MemoryInMbLimit) services is approaching the absolute limit (that you specified in Megabytes, as required by SF RG configuration).  

***Solution:*** AppObserver is your friend. 

You need to first enable the global setting for RG Monitoring in AppObserver's ApplicationManifest Application Parameters section: 

```XML
    <!-- AppObserver can monitor services with resource governance limits set and put related services into Warning if they reach 90% of the specified limit (only Memory limit is supported in this release). 
         If you set RG Memory limits for your service code packages, then you should consider enabling this feature. Else, don't. -->
    <Parameter Name="AppObserverMonitorResourceGovernanceLimits" DefaultValue="true" />
```

The above setting is a big on/off switch for the feature. If this is not set to true, then it doesn't matter what you configure in the AppObserver configuration (Json) below. This is useful because, like all Application Parameters in FabricObserver,
you can modify them with a versionless, parameter-only Application Upgrade versus a redeployment or a Configuration Upgrade (Config and Code versions must change).

Now, as the XML comment above makes clear, by default, when you enable this feature FabricObserver will warn when you have reached 90% or more of your specified MemoryInMbLimit that you set in the target app's ApplicationManifest (ResourceGovernancePolicy element for the related service code package). If you are fine with that 
for all of your services that have RG enabled for Memory limiting, then you don't need to worry about the following information. Your work is done. If you do want to control this value - and also be able to specify different thresholds for different services - well, read on. 

You can override FabricObserver's default 90% value by specifying a ```warningRGMemoryLimitPercent``` property in your AppObserver.config.json file for some RG-enabled app. Note that the below example also includes multiple overrides that are per service for an application named Voting. This is done to show you how 
to accomplish such a thing, which is probably useful for many. You can also just simply override the global setting (object with "targetApp": "*") like below (so, 80 instead of 90) and this will be applied to all of your memory allocation limited (RG) services. The other objects show how to employ serviceIncludeList so narrow down the service scope for this particular threshold override.

```JSON
[
  {
    "targetApp": "*",
    "cpuWarningLimitPercent": 85,
    "memoryWarningLimitMb": 1024,
    "networkWarningEphemeralPortsPercent": 30,
    "warningThreadCount": 500,
    "warningOpenFileHandles": 7000,
    "warningPrivateBytesMb": 1280,
    "warningRGMemoryLimitPercent": 80
  },
  {
    "targetApp": "Voting",
    "serviceIncludeList": "VotingData",
    "warningRGMemoryLimitPercent": 75
  },
  {
    "targetApp": "Voting",
    "serviceIncludeList": "VotingWeb",
    "warningRGMemoryLimitPercent": 105
  }
]
```  

Note that 105 value for VotingWeb. Huh? Well, that is actually very useful because it effectively means "don't put VotingWeb into Warning when it approaches the memory limit I set for its code package in ApplicationManifest.xml". This is because VotingWeb will have already OOM'd and crashed (or not, perhaps you force a GC and get out of the problem in user code or you have a design bug where you catch and ignore OOMs (you can do this in .NET. ***Don't do that!***)).
So, set the value higher than 100% and you are telling FO to effectively ignore the service with respect to RG limit warning. As always, it's all up to you! 


**Disk Usage - Space**  

***Problem:*** I want to know when my local disks are filling up well before my cluster goes down, along with the VM.

***Solution:*** DiskObserver to the rescue. 

DiskObserver's Threshold setting values are required to be overriden and are set in FO's ApplicationManifest.xml file.

Set the DiskSpacePercentUsageWarningThreshold parameter in DiskObserver's configuration section located in FO's ***ApplicationManifest.xml*** file and it will warn you when disk space consumption reaches 80%:

```XML
    <!-- Disk Observer Warning/Error Thresholds -->
    <Parameter Name="DiskSpacePercentUsageWarningThreshold" DefaultValue="80" />
    <Parameter Name="DiskSpacePercentUsageErrorThreshold" DefaultValue="" />
    <Parameter Name="AverageQueueLengthErrorThreshold" DefaultValue="" />
    <Parameter Name="AverageQueueLengthWarningThreshold" DefaultValue="15" />
```  

Example Output in SFX (Warning): 

![alt text](/Documentation/Images/DiskObsWarn.png "DiskObserver Warning output example.")  


**Memory Usage - Private Working Set - Percentage of Total Physical Memory** 

***Problem:*** I want to know how much memory some or all of my services are using and warn when they hit some meaningful percent-used thresold.  

***Solution:*** AppObserver is your friend.  

The first two JSON objects below tell AppObserver to warn when any of the services under MyApp app reach 30% memory use (as a percentage of total memory). 
 
The third one scopes to all services _but_ 3 and asks AppObserver to warn when any of them hit 40% memory use on the machine (virtual or not).

```JSON
[
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/MyApp",
    "memoryWarningLimitPercent": 30
  },
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/AnotherApp",
    "memoryWarningLimitPercent": 30
  },
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/SomeOtherApp",
    "serviceExcludeList": "WhoNeedsMemoryService, NoMemoryNoProblemService, Service42",
    "memoryWarningLimitPercent": 40
  }
]
```   

**Memory Usage - Private Working Set - Absolute value in Megabytes** 

***Problem:*** I want to know how much memory some or all of my services are using and warn when they hit some meaningful Megabytes in use thresold.  

***Solution:*** AppObserver is your friend.  

The first two JSON objects below tell AppObserver to warn when any of the services under MyApp app reach 30% memory use (as a percentage of total memory). 
 
The third one scopes to all services _but_ 3 and asks AppObserver to warn when any of them hit 40% memory use on the machine (virtual or not).

```JSON
[
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/MyApp",
    "memoryWarningLimitPercent": 300
  },
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/AnotherApp",
    "memoryWarningLimitMb": 500
  },
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/SomeOtherApp",
    "serviceExcludeList": "WhoNeedsMemoryService, NoMemoryNoProblemService, Service42",
    "memoryWarningLimitMb": 600
  }
]
```   

**Memory Usage - Private Bytes - Absolute value in Megabytes** 

***Problem:*** I want to know how much virtual memory some or all of my services are ***comitting*** and warn when they hit some meaningful Megabytes in use thresold.  

***Solution:*** AppObserver is your friend.  

```JSON
[
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/MyApp",
    "warningPrivateBytes": 800
  },
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/AnotherApp",
    "warningPrivateBytes": 500
  },
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/SomeOtherApp",
    "serviceExcludeList": "WhoNeedsMemoryService, NoMemoryNoProblemService, Service42",
    "warningPrivateBytes": 2048
  }
]
``` 

**Different thresholds for different services belonging to the same app**  

***Problem:*** I want to monitor and report on different services for different thresholds 
for one app.  

***Solution:*** Easy. You can supply any number of array items in AppObserver's JSON configuration file
regardless of target - there is no requirement for unique target properties in the object array. 

```JSON
[
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/MyApp",
    "serviceIncludeList": "MyCpuEatingService1, MyCpuEatingService2",
    "cpuWarningLimitPercent": 45
  },
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/MyApp",
    "serviceIncludeList": "MemoryCrunchingService1, MemoryCrunchingService42",
    "memoryWarningLimitPercent": 30
  }
]
```


If what you really want to do is monitor for different thresholds (like CPU and Memory) for a set of services, you would
just add the threshold properties to one object: 

```JSON
[  
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/MyApp",
    "serviceIncludeList": "MyCpuEatingService1, MyCpuEatingService2, MemoryCrunchingService1, MemoryCrunchingService42",
    "cpuWarningLimitPercent": 45,
    "memoryWarningLimitPercent": 30
  }
]
```  

The following configuration tells AppObserver to monitor and report Warnings for multiple resources for two services belonging to MyApp:  
 

```JSON
[
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/MyApp",
    "serviceIncludeList": "MyService42, MyOtherService42",
    "cpuErrorLimitPercent": 90,
    "cpuWarningLimitPercent": 80,
    "memoryWarningLimitPercent": 70,
    "networkWarningActivePorts": 800,
    "networkWarningEphemeralPorts": 400
  }
]
``` 

**All App Monitoring** 

***Problem:*** I don't care what the app is, I just want to monitor all app services deployed to any node.  

***Solution:*** AppObserver is your friend.  Note, you can specify all app targets using either "*" or "All" (case doesn't matter). 

The configuration below specifies that AppObserver is to monitor and report thresholds breaches for a collection of metrics on all services that belong to any app that is deployed to the node.  

Note that AppObserver does not (and will not) monitor fabric:/System app services. Also, individual targetApp configuration items will override the global configuration when the same thresholds are supplied. 

In the example below, the setting for cpuWarningLimitPercent for fabric:/MyApp will override the same setting specified in the all inclusive config item. fabric:/MyApp will still be monitored for the other global metrics.

```JSON
[
  {
    "targetApp": "*",
    "cpuWarningLimitPercent": 75,
    "memoryWarningLimitMb" : 500,
    "networkWarningActivePorts": 2000,
    "networkWarningEphemeralPorts": 1500,
    "warningThreadCount": 500
  },
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/MyApp",
    "cpuWarningLimitPercent": 50,
    "warningThreadCount": 300
  }
]
```   
***Problem:*** I don't care what the app is, I just want to monitor all app services deployed to any node, except for fabric:/MyApp, where I only care about raw memory use (MB) by any of its services. 

***Solution:*** AppObserver is your friend.  Note, you can specify all app targets using either "*" or "All" (case doesn't matter). 

The configuration below specifies that AppObserver is to monitor and report threshold breaches for a collection of metrics on all services that belong to any app that is deployed to the node, except for fabric:/MyApp.  

```JSON
[
  {
    "targetApp": "*",
    "appExcludeList": "fabric:/MyApp",
    "cpuWarningLimitPercent": 75,
    "memoryWarningLimitPerceent" : 40,
    "networkWarningActivePorts": 2000,
    "networkWarningEphemeralPorts": 1500
  },
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/MyApp",
    "memoryWarningLimitMb": 600
  }
]
```   
***Problem:*** I want to monitor the same resource metrics used by 3 apps and I don't like writing JSON.

***Solution:*** AppObserver is your friend.  Note, you can specify all app targets using either "*" or "All"(case doesn't matter). 

The configuration below specifies that AppObserver is to monitor and report threshold breaches for a collection of metrics on all services that belong to the apps supplied in appIncludeList.  

```JSON
[
  {
    "targetApp": "*",
    "appIncludeList": "fabric:/MyApp, fabric:/MyApp2, fabric:/MyApp3",
    "cpuWarningLimitPercent": 75,
    "memoryWarningLimitPerceent" : 40,
    "networkWarningActivePorts": 2000,
    "networkWarningEphemeralPorts": 1500
  }
]
``` 

**Advanced Debugging - Windows Process Dumps (Linux support TBD)**  

***Problem:*** I want to dump any of my Windows SF service processes that are eating too much memory.

***Solution:*** AppObserver is your friend.  Note, you can specify all app targets using either "*" or "All"(case doesn't matter). 
In this case, AppObserver will initiate a mini dump (MiniPlus by default) of an offending process running on Windows and only if the specified Error threshold has been breached (so, only Memory has an Error threshold specified, thus only that metric will be used to initiate a dump). You can configure [AzureStorageUploadObserver](/Documentation/Observers.md#azurestorageuploadobserver) to ship the dmp (compressed to zip file) to a blob in your Azure storage account.
Please see [Observers documentation](/Documentation/Observers.md), specifically App and AzureStorageUpload observer sections for details on this process dump and upload feature.

```JSON
{
    "targetApp": "*",
    "appExcludeList": "fabric:/SomeApp, fabric:/SomeOtherApp",
    "cpuWarningLimitPercent": 85,
    "memoryErrorLimitMb": 1048,
    "dumpProcessOnError": true,
    "networkWarningActivePorts": 8000,
    "networkWarningEphemeralPorts": 7500
  }
```

***Problem:*** I want to dump only services that belong to one application when any of them are consuming too much of any specified resource metric, but I *don't* want to put any service entities into Error state because I don't like the consequences of doing so (blocking Repair Jobs, blocking upgrades, etc..).

***Solution:*** AppObserver to the rescue. ```dumpProcessOnWarning``` is the droid you're looking for, specifically.

The configuration below below demonstrates how to add specific properties to one application that extend the global ("*") settings, which are applied to all application services. The specified targetApp in the second Json object will have all the settings applied that are specified in the first Json object plus the dumpProcessOnWarning setting.
This means that if any of the Voting app's services have reached or exceeded any of the specified Warning level thresholds, then they will be dumped. 

```JSON
[
  {
    "targetApp": "*",
    "cpuWarningLimitPercent": 85,
    "memoryWarningLimitMb": 1024,
    "networkWarningEphemeralPorts": 10000,
    "warningThreadCount": 600
  },
  {
    "targetApp": "Voting",
    "dumpProcessOnWarning": true
  }
]
```

***Problem:*** I want to dump only specific services that belong to one application when any of them are consuming too much of any specified resource metric, but I *don't* want to put any service entities into Error state because I don't like the consequences of doing so (blocking Repair Jobs, blocking upgrades, etc..).

***Solution:*** AppObserver to the rescue. ```dumpProcessOnWarning``` is the droid you're looking for, specifically.

The configuration below below demonstrates how to add specific properties to one application that extend the global ("\*") settings, which are applied to all application services. The specified targetApp in the second Json object will have all the settings applied that are specified in the first Json object plus the dumpProcessOnWarning setting
and **only** for the specified service in the serviceIncludeList property. Note that this setting means that any other service that belongs to the application will not be monitored (since they are effectively excluded). The work around is to add new objects for each of the those services. See below for an example.
The third section (with serviceIncludeList for "Web") means that the included service will be monitored based on the global ("\*") config block. However, it's process will not be dumped if it goes into Warning. 

```JSON
[
  {
    "targetApp": "*",
    "cpuWarningLimitPercent": 85,
    "memoryWarningLimitMb": 1024,
    "networkWarningEphemeralPorts": 10000,
    "warningThreadCount": 600
  },
  {
    "targetApp": "Voting",
    "serviceIncludeList": "Data",
    "dumpProcessOnWarning": true
  },
  {
    "targetApp": "Voting",
    "serviceIncludeList": "Web",
    "dumpProcessOnWarning": false
  }
]
```

***NOTE***: Unlike applying an Error threshold to a single metric in a list of only Warning thresholds, you will need to use dumpProcessOnWarning carefully (so, do not specify it in a global setting object if you DO NOT want FO to dump ANY service process that hits ANY specified Warning threshold. That is probably not something you want to do..)
Put another way, do not apply this setting in the global config Json object ("targetApp": "\*" block). Just target specific apps only. As always, you are free to do whatever makes sense for your specific needs, but tread carefully here.

Also, FO will *not* dump a Resource Governed process that is put into Warning for crossing the specified ```warningRGMemoryLimitPercent``` threshold.

**What about the state of the Machine, as a whole?** 

***Problem:*** I want to know when Total CPU Time and Memory Consumption on the VM (or real machine)
reaches certain points and then emit a Warning.  

***Solution:*** Enter NodeObserver.  

NodeObserver doesn't speak JSON (can you believe it!!??....). So, you simply set the desired warning thresholds in FO's ApplicationManifest.xml file:  

```XML
    <!-- NodeObserver Warning/Error Thresholds -->
    <Parameter Name="NodeObserverCpuErrorLimitPercent" DefaultValue="" />
    <Parameter Name="NodeObserverCpuWarningLimitPercent" DefaultValue="90" />
    <Parameter Name="NodeObserverMemoryErrorLimitMb" DefaultValue="" />
    <Parameter Name="NodeObserverMemoryWarningLimitMb" DefaultValue="" />
    <Parameter Name="NodeObserverMemoryErrorLimitPercent" DefaultValue="" />
    <Parameter Name="NodeObserverMemoryWarningLimitPercent" DefaultValue="85" />
```

**Networking: Endpoint Availability**  

***Problem:*** I want to know when the endpoints I care about are not reachable.  

***Solution:*** NetworkObserver at your service. 

Let's say you have 3 critical endpoints that you want to monitor for availability and emit warnings when they are unreachable. 

In NetworkObserver's configuration file (PackageRoot/Config/NetworkObserver.config.json), add this:  


```JSON
[
  {
    "targetApp": "fabric:/MyApp",
    "endpoints": [
      {
        "hostname": "critical.endpoint.com",
        "port": 443,
        "protocol": "http"
      },
      {

***Problem***: I want to get telemetry that includes aggregated cluster health for use in alerting.  

***Solution***: [ClusterObserver](/ClusterObserver) is your friend.  

ClusterObserver is a stateless singleton service that runs on one node in your cluster. It can be
configured to emit telemetry to your Azure ApplicationInsights or Azure LogAnalytics workspace out of the box. 
All you have to do is provide either your instrumentation key in two files: Settings.xml and ApplicationInsights.config or 
supply your Azure LogAnalytics WorkspaceId and SharedKey in Settings.xml. You can 
configure CO to emit Warning state signals in addition to the default Error signalling. It's up to you.  

ClusterObserver's ObserverManager config (Settings.xml). These are not overridable:

```XML
  <Section Name="ObserverManagerConfiguration">
    <!-- Required: Amount of time, in seconds, to sleep before the next iteration of observers run loop. 
         0 means run continuously with no pausing. We recommend at least 60 seconds for ClusterObserver. -->
    <Parameter Name="ObserverLoopSleepTimeSeconds" Value="60" />
    <!-- Required: Amount of time, in seconds, ClusterObserver is allowed to complete a run. If this time is exceeded, 
         then the offending observer will be marked as broken and will not run again. 
         Below setting represents 30 minutes. -->
    <Parameter Name="ObserverExecutionTimeout" Value="1800" />
    <!-- Optional: This observer makes async SF Api calls that are cluster-wide operations and can take time in large clusters. -->
    <Parameter Name="AsyncOperationTimeoutSeconds" Value="120" />
    <!-- Required: Location on disk to store observer data, including ObserverManager. 
         ClusterObserver will write to its own directory on this path.
         **NOTE: For Linux runtime target, just supply the name of the directory (not a path with drive letter like you for Windows).** -->
    <Parameter Name="ObserverLogPath" Value="clusterobserver_logs" />
    <!-- Required: Enabling this will generate noisy logs. Disabling it means only Warning and Error information 
         will be locally logged. This is the recommended setting. -->
    <Parameter Name="EnableVerboseLogging" Value="False" />
    <Parameter Name="EnableEventSourceProvider" Value="True" />
    <!-- Required: Whether the Observer should send all of its monitoring data and Warnings/Errors to configured Telemetry service. This can be overriden by the setting 
         in the ClusterObserverConfiguration section. The idea there is that you can do an application parameter update and turn this feature on and off. -->

By design, CO will send an Ok health state report when a cluster goes from Warning or Error state to Ok.

Example Configuration:  

```XML
  <!-- ClusterObserver Configuration Settings. NOTE: These are overridable settings, see ApplicationManifest.xml. 
       The Values for these will be overriden by ApplicationManifest Parameter settings. Set DefaultValue for each
       overridable parameter in that file, not here, as the parameter DefaultValues in ApplicationManifest.xml will be used, by default. 
       This design is to enable unversioned application-parameter-only updates. This means you will be able to change
       any of the MustOverride parameters below at runtime by doing an ApplicationUpdate with ApplicationParameters flag. 
       See: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-application-upgrade-advanced#upgrade-application-parameters-independently-of-version -->
  <Section Name="ClusterObserverConfiguration">
    <!-- Maximum amount of time to wait for an async operation to complete (e.g., any of the SF API calls..) -->
    <Parameter Name="AsyncOperationTimeoutSeconds" Value="" MustOverride="true" />
    <!-- Required: To enable or not enable, that is the question.-->
    <Parameter Name="Enabled" Value="" MustOverride="true" />
    <!-- Optional: Enabling this will generate noisy logs. Disabling it means only Warning and Error information 
         will be locally logged. This is the recommended setting. -->
    <Parameter Name="EnableVerboseLogging" Value="" MustOverride="true" />
    <!-- Optional: Emit health details for both Warning and Error for aggregated cluster health? 
         Aggregated Error evaluations will always be transmitted regardless of this setting. -->
    <Parameter Name="EmitHealthWarningEvaluationDetails" Value="" MustOverride="true" />
    <!-- Maximum amount of time a node can be in disabling/disabled/down state before
         emitting a Warning signal.-->
    <Parameter Name="MaxTimeNodeStatusNotOk" Value="" MustOverride="true" />
    <!-- How often to run ClusterObserver. This is a Timespan value, e.g., 00:10:00 means every 10 minutes, for example. -->
    <Parameter Name="RunInterval" Value="" MustOverride="true" />
  </Section>

ApplicationManifest.xml is where you set Overridable settings.  

  <Parameters>
    <!-- ClusterObserver settings. -->
    <Parameter Name="ClusterObserver_InstanceCount" DefaultValue="1" />
    <Parameter Name="Enabled" DefaultValue="true" />

You deploy CO into your cluster just as you would any other Service Fabric service.
### Application Parameter Updates
<a name="parameterUpdates"></a>
***Problem***: I want to update an Observer's settings without having to redeploy the application.

***Solution***: [Application Upgrade with Configuration-Parameters-only update](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-application-upgrade-advanced#upgrade-application-parameters-independently-of-version) to the rescue.

Example: 

Open an Admin Powershell console.

Connect to your Service Fabric cluster using Connect-ServiceFabricCluster command. 

Create a variable that contains all the settings you want update:

```Powershell
$appParams = @{ "FabricSystemObserverEnabled" = "true"; "FabricSystemObserverMemoryWarningLimitMb" = "4096"; }
```

Then execute the application upgrade with

```Powershell
Start-ServiceFabricApplicationUpgrade -ApplicationName fabric:/FabricObserver -ApplicationTypeVersion 3.3.1 -ApplicationParameter $appParams -Monitored -FailureAction rollback
```  

**Important**: This action will overwrite previous app paramemter changes that were made in an earlier application upgrade, for example. If you want to preserve any earlier changes, then you will need to
supply those parameter values again along with the new ones. You do this in the following, simple way: 

```PowerShell
$appName = "fabric:/FabricObserver"
$appVersion = "3.3.1"
$application = Get-ServiceFabricApplication -ApplicationName $appName
$appParamCollection = $application.ApplicationParameters
$applicationParameterMap = @{}

# Fill the map with current app parameter settings.
foreach ($pair in $appParamCollection)
{
    $applicationParameterMap.Add($pair.Name, $pair.Value);
}

# Change existing app parameter values.
$applicationParameterMap["AppObserverEnableVerboseLogging"] = "true"

# Start the upgrade.
Start-ServiceFabricApplicationUpgrade -ApplicationName $appName -ApplicationTypeVersion $appVersion -ApplicationParameter $applicationParameterMap -UnMonitoredAuto
```

**For Linux, FO app parameter upgrades will restart FO processes** (one at a time, UD Walk with safety checks) due to the way Linux Capabilites work. 
In a nutshell, for any kind of application upgrade, we have to re-run the FO setup script to get the Capabilities in place, which requires restarting FabricObserver (which is just fine given that it is a stateless service).
**For Windows, FO processes will NOT be restarted by default, but SF Hosting may decide to restart depending upon the number of parameters that are modified and/or the type of change (like changing RG values, for example)**.
